Info that will need to get worked out in the software:
- scheduling
- app control
- switching between manual control and automated timing

Need to being establishing the logic for switching between the two modes of operating.
1. manual mode (user requests a feed through an app or something). may need to use an analog input to keep it simple and get it going.
2. automated scheduling mode based on a schedule originally set by a user.

First version:
- user input from an analog HIGH from a physical tactile button which will be the trigger. Some implementation to prevent toggle will be needed as well.
note: will need to define states as well.
